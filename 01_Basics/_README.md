\# Basics Programs in C



This folder contains beginner-level C programs that cover input/output, conditionals, loops, operators, and simple patterns.  

These exercises build a strong foundation for problem solving in C.



\## Programs Included



1\. \*\*Hello World\*\* (`hello\_world.c`) â€“ Prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.  

2\. \*\*Sum of Two Numbers\*\* (`sum\_of\_two\_numbers.c`) â€“ Adds two integers entered by the user.  

3\. \*\*Simple Calculator\*\* (`simple\_calculator.c`) â€“ Performs +, -, \*, / operations using switch-case.  

4\. \*\*Even or Odd\*\* (`even\_or\_odd.c`) â€“ Checks if a number is even or odd.  

5\. \*\*Largest of Three Numbers\*\* (`largest\_of\_three.c`) â€“ Finds the largest among three numbers.  

6\. \*\*Factorial\*\* (`factorial.c`) â€“ Calculates the factorial of a number using loops.  

7\. \*\*Fibonacci Series\*\* (`fibonacci\_series.c`) â€“ Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.  

8\. \*\*Reverse a Number\*\* (`reverse\_number.c`) â€“ Reverses the digits of a given integer.  

9\. \*\*Palindrome Number\*\* (`palindrome\_number.c`) â€“ Checks if a number reads the same forwards and backwards.  

10\. \*\*Armstrong Number\*\* (`armstrong\_number.c`) â€“ Checks if a number is an Armstrong number (general method for n digits).  

11\. \*\*Prime Number Check\*\* (`prime\_number\_check.c`) â€“ Determines if a number is prime.  

12\. \*\*Star Pattern\*\* (`star\_pattern.c`) â€“ Prints a simple star pattern using nested loops.
