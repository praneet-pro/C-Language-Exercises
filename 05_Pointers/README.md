\# ðŸ“Œ Pointers in C



This folder contains programs that demonstrate various concepts of pointers in C.  

Each program shows how pointers can be used for memory management, arrays, strings, functions, and structures.

| 1   | pointer\_basics.c              | Demonstrates printing the address and value of a variable using pointers.   |

| 2   | swap\_using\_pointers.c         | Swaps two numbers using pointers.                                           |

| 3   | array\_using\_pointers.c        | Traverses and displays array elements using pointers.                       |

| 4   | string\_using\_pointers.c       | Demonstrates string input/output and traversal using pointers.              |
