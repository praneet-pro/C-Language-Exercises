\# Functions Programs in C



This folder contains programs that demonstrate the use of functions in C, including recursion, parameter passing, and modular programming.



| S.No | Program Name                    | Description |

|------|----------------------------------|-------------|

| 1    | factorial\_function.c             | Calculates the factorial of a number using a function. |

| 2    | fibonacci\_recursion.c            | Prints the Fibonacci series using recursion. |

| 3    | gcd\_function.c                   | Finds the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers. |

| 4    | lcm\_function.c                   | Finds the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers. |

| 5    | prime\_check\_function.c           | Checks whether a given number is prime using a function. |

| 6    | power\_function.c                 | Computes the power of a number using a function. |

| 7    | sum\_of\_digits\_function.c         | Finds the sum of digits of a number using a function. |

| 8    | reverse\_number\_function.c        | Reverses a number using a function. |

| 9    | max\_min\_array\_function.c         | Finds the maximum and minimum element in an array using a function. |

| 10   | swap\_function.c                  | Swaps two numbers using a function (with pointers). |

| 11   | menu\_driven\_math.c               | Performs multiple math operations (Add, Sub, Mul, Div, Factorial) using a menu-driven program. |
