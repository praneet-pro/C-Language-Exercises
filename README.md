# ðŸ“˜ C Programming Practice Repository  

Welcome to my **C programming practice repository**! ðŸš€  
This repo contains well-structured programs organized into different topics, covering everything from basics to advanced concepts like pointers, structures, and enums.  

Each folder includes:  
- âœ… Multiple C programs  
- âœ… README with program tables (clickable links + descriptions)  
- âœ… Example input/output where needed

## âš¡ Compilation & Execution  

Each program is written in **C** and can be compiled using:  

```bash
gcc program_name.c -o program_name
./program_name
